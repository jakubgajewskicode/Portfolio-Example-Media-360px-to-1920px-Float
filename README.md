# CSS Case Study : Portfolio example [@Media 360px to  1920px ,Float]

Portfolio is a simple page where I used: 

- @Media orientation: landscape and portait in order to fix problems with a imgs and text 

- Using Float and fixing sections location problem by using: 

 .clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}

- Placeing elements in the right place using : position: relative / absolute

- z-index 

- all functions with border-box
